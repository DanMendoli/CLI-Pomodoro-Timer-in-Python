-- Very simple CLI pomodoro timer made in Python --


Usage:
    
    On Linux:
        
        In terminal, open the directory containing the "pomodoro_timer.py" file 
        and activate the virtual environment by typing the command 
            
            "source venv/bin/activate" 
        
        Then type:
            
            "python3 pomodoro_timer.py" 
        
        and start the script.
        
    On Windows:
        
        The script was writen to run directly on Linux, but if you wanna 
        run it on windows, just edit the "pomodoro_timer.py" file: searh for all the 
        lines containing the "clear" word and replace it for "cls", which is the clear 
        screen command on windows. Save the file and run the scrip by following the same 
        steps as on Linux.

     *   If ou don't wanna run it by the virtual environment, just get the 
     *   necessary modules on your main Python 3 install location.

     *       - time
     *       - os
